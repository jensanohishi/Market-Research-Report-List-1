<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NOx Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Reaction</li><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Reaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The NOx control systems market features two main technologies: Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). SNCR involves injecting urea or ammonia into flue gas at high temperatures, facilitating a non-catalytic reaction to convert NOx into nitrogen and water. In contrast, SCR employs a catalyst to enhance the reaction efficiency between NOx and a reductant, typically ammonia, at lower temperatures. Both methods aim to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions from industrial processes and enhance compliance with environmental regulations.</p></p>
