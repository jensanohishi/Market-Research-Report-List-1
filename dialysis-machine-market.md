<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialysis Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li><li>Hemodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dialysis machine market comprises two primary types: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis utilizes the patient's abdominal lining to filter waste, allowing for home treatment and greater patient autonomy. In contrast, hemodialysis relies on an external machine and dialyzer to cleanse the blood, typically requiring treatment in clinical settings. Both methods serve to manage kidney failure efficiently, but they cater to different patient needs and preferences, shaping their respective market demands and growth dynamics.</p></p>
